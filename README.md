My colleagues and I created WPF app with C# as part of the Software Specification and Modeling and Human Interaction courses. The purpose of this app is to help patients, doctors and hospital management be more efficient. I developed doctor functionalities such as scheduling and rescheduling operation or examination, writing medical reports or prescriptions, etc. Also, I had a special request to adapt the doctor page design to older visually impaired persons. You can test the app by logging in as a doctor\n
